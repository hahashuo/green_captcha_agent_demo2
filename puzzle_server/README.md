A comprehensive web-based platform for testing and benchmarking Multimodal LLM Web Agents on CAPTCHA-style puzzles. This project provides an environment to evaluate how artificial intelligence systems perform on a variety of visual puzzles resembling CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart). 

Based on our research paper: **"Open CaptchaWorld: A Comprehensive Web-based Platform for Testing and Benchmarking Multimodal LLM Agents"**. Below are some examples from our Open CaptchaWorld.

## 🌟 Overview

Open CaptchaWorld enables systematic evaluation of multimodal AI capabilities through CAPTCHA-style puzzles. It provides a controlled environment for testing how well LLM Web Agents can:

- Perceive and understand visual elements
- Extract relevant information from images
- Generate appropriate responses to visual puzzles
- Interact with web interfaces to solve tasks

The system includes a variety of CAPTCHA types ranging from basic (count dice) to complex (rotate objects to match reference direction), providing a comprehensive assessment of AI visual reasoning capabilities.

## 🎯 Motivation & Contributions

### Why We Built Open CaptchaWorld

Modern web interfaces increasingly rely on CAPTCHA systems to differentiate between human users and automated systems. This presents a significant challenge for LLM Web Agents attempting to navigate and interact with the real world:

1. **Real-World Deployment Barrier:** Web Agents frequently get stuck on websites that include CAPTCHA tests, significantly slowing down their deployment for everyday real-world usage. Without the ability to solve these challenges, LLM Web Agents cannot fully realize their potential as digital assistants.

2. **Outdated Evaluation Methods:** Many traditional CAPTCHAs can now be easily solved by specialized detection and classification models, making them poor benchmarks for evaluating the complete reasoning, visual understanding, and interaction capabilities of modern Web Agents.

### Our Contributions

Open CaptchaWorld addresses these challenges through several key contributions:

1. **Comprehensive CAPTCHA Collection:** We have collected and implemented an extensive set of modern CAPTCHA types specifically designed to test the multi-modal reasoning capabilities required by Web Agents.

2. **First Open-Source Benchmark:** To our knowledge, this is the first open-sourced CAPTCHA benchmark and dataset specifically tailored for Web Agents, providing a standardized environment for researchers and developers.

3. **Training Data Generation:** Beyond evaluation, Open CaptchaWorld serves as a platform for generating high-quality training data that can improve Web Agents' ability to handle CAPTCHA challenges.

4. **Real-World Simulation:** Our platform closely emulates actual web interfaces, enabling more realistic testing of Web Agents' capabilities to navigate websites protected by CAPTCHA mechanisms.

By making Open CaptchaWorld available to the research community, we aim to accelerate progress in developing more capable, adaptable, and useful Web Agents that can seamlessly interact with today's web interfaces.


## ✨ Features

- **20 CAPTCHA Types**: Diverse set of visual puzzles to test different capabilities
- **Web Interface**: Clean, intuitive interface for human or AI interaction
- **API Endpoints**: Programmatic access to puzzles and verification
- **Benchmark Tracking**: Automatic recording of performance metrics
- **CLI Management**: Tools for managing CAPTCHA puzzles and types
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy addition of new puzzle types

## 🧪 Benchmark CLI (New)

To make it easy to experiment with different multimodal LLM backbones, the repository now ships with an agent-friendly CLI built on top of the bundled `browser-use` framework.

```bash
# Activate your environment, install browser-use, and ensure Playwright/Chromium is available
python -m agent_frameworks.browseruse_cli --url http://10.127.49.104:7860 (or any address you wish to use) --llm browser-use --limit 5
```

The CLI launches a `browser-use` agent and asks it to solve puzzles directly in the running web UI. Switch providers with `--llm` (supported values: `browser-use`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `google`, `groq`, `azure-openai`) and pass `--model` when a backend needs an explicit checkpoint (for example `--llm openai --model gpt-4.1`). Use `--use-cloud` to run against Browser Use Cloud or `--headless` for local headless testing.

> Tip: Provide provider API keys through environment variables (`BROWSER_USE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.) before running the CLI. Or for more convient, set up all in .env.example file once, then you are free to go.

### 🤖 CrewAI CLI (agent framework option)

Prefer orchestrating agents with CrewAI? Install the optional dependencies and launch the dedicated CLI:

```bash
pip install crewai "crewai-tools[playwright]" langchain-openai

python -m agent_frameworks.crewai_cli --url http://127.0.0.1:5000 --limit 3 --provider openai --model gpt-4o-mini
```

- Switch providers with `--provider` (`openai`, `anthropic`, `google`, `groq`, `azure-openai`) and pass `--model` to target a specific checkpoint when required.
- CrewAI relies on LangChain provider packages (e.g. `langchain-anthropic`, `langchain-google-genai`, `langchain-groq`) and expects the appropriate API keys in your environment (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, etc.).
- Install `crewai-tools[playwright]` to enable the bundled `BrowserTool`, which lets the Crew interact with the OpenCaptchaWorld page.
- **Notice: when we conducted our experiments, CrewAI (and the LangChain stack it sits on) still depends on Pydantic v1, which isn’t compatible with Python 3.14+. You may need to create a new virtual env with Python 3.12.**

## 🧩 CAPTCHA Types

Open CaptchaWorld includes 20 distinct CAPTCHA types, each testing different visual reasoning capabilities:

1. **Dice_Count**: Count and sum numbers on dice
2. **Geometry_Click**: Click on a specific geometric shape
3. **Rotation_Match**: Rotate an object to match a reference orientation
4. **Slide_Puzzle**: Drag a component to a target position
5. **Unusual_Detection**: Identify unusual items in a grid
6. **Image_Recognition**: Select images matching a description
7. **Bingo**: Swap positions to create a line of matching images
8. **Image_Matching**: Match similar images
9. **Patch_Select**: Select grid squares containing specific objects
10. **Dart_Count**: Select an image where darts sum to a target number
11. **Object_Match**: Match the number of objects to a reference
12. **Select_Animal**: Identify a specific animal in a grid
13. **Coordinates**: Move an object to specified coordinates
14. **Path_Finder**: Navigate to a target position
15. **Place_Dot**: Place a dot at a specific location
16. **Connect_icon**: Connect matching icons

18. **Hold_Button**: Hold a button for a specified duration
19. **Misleading_Click**: Click in the correct area, avoiding distractions
20. **Pick_Area**: Select a specific area in an image

Each type has its own directory in `captcha_data/` containing puzzle images and a `ground_truth.json` file with solutions.

## 📊 Benchmark Results

The system records benchmark results in `benchmark_results.json` with each entry containing:
- Puzzle type
- Puzzle ID
- User's answer
- Correct answer
- Boolean indicating correctness
- Timestamp

This data can be used to analyze performance across different puzzle types and track improvement over time.
